![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8c4941b-ed0e-4177-a75d-6dfaff0df2c4)

This is a set of 3 plug-ins, which can be used in Digital Audio Workstations to process audio. Built with [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE), C++ and [Max MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max).

There are 3 plug-ins that can be used:
- Freeverb Reverb, a Schroeder-Moorer reverberator originally developed by “Jezar at Dreampoint”.
- Doppler Effect, a spatialization plug-in to create the effect of space and motion.
- Bit crusher, a distortion plug-in, which reduces the resolution of your audio signal.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

There is a Mac installer in the repository - `Audio Plugin Installer.pkg`. You can download it, run it and the plugins will be installed in Mac's Audio Unit folder. Otherwise, follow [this tutorial here](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209068929-Using-AU-and-VST-plug-ins-on-macOS).

For Windows, the plug-ins would need to be built to VST3, sorry!
